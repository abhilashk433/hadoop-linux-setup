# hadoop-linux-setup
Python scripts to assist setting up Hadoop v1 in Linux and starting a NameNode, DataNodes and Client.

**INTRODUCTION:**
A Hadoop v1 cluster consists of a `master` or `namenode`, along with some `slaves` or `datanodes` and a `client` to dictate the storage of data in the *Hadoop Distributed File System*. However setting up Hadoop Cluster in Linux everytime is tedious task which can be easily achieved by this easy to use Hadoop Setup Tool.

**Python 3 scripts for HADOOPÂ© v1 HDFS:**
It uses python scripts to set up a `NameNode`, format it and start it. It configures the all the DataNodes and all the Clients to work collectively in an HDFS. The Main file is `hadoopsetup.py`, the rest are supporting files. To make the tasks easier it also uses `ssh` to gain authorization and all the machines connected have easy access to each other while the setup is being done. `ssh-keygen` command is automated as required.
